**Oops!**

**I'm still working on the documentation so some information can be not completed!**

## Description
AmibLed is a low budget Philips Ambilight copy for *WS2812B Leds + Arduino + PC* setup. System is based on PC Aplication which sends information to microcontroller that changes specific leds on strip. Led strip refreshes aroud 15 times per second (Arduino data sending is not optimized :/) but its enough to watch movies with cool colorful effect!

* [3. Hardware](#hardware)
* [4. How To Use](#how-to-use)

## Prerequisites
To run the whole system you need some things. Here is a list with required hardware to even start thinking about testing the software:
* **Mid-end PC** *(the program is Cyberpunk-like optimized!)*
* **Arduino Uno** *(or cheaper replacement)*
* **WS2812B Leds with adapter** [here's](https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/power-any-ws2812b-setup) a link with led strip powering instructions
* **USB-B cable** *(the printer cable)* to connect Arduino and PC
* **Some Arduino cables** to connect leds with arduino and adapter

## Software
If you are already stocked with required things you can prepare the program for your PC

  ### Download and Installation
  There's two ways: you can download the master branch with code, check how it's working and compile whole application in *Visual Studio 2019*, or simply download it from link below and run it from *PcLedVisualization.exe*
  
  [Here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y1SYh1i5DQcvLbZ9M6i9LgA-GesjCVTb/view?usp=sharing) the download link for the newest version of the program
  
  If the program runs with no problems you are good to go! Software preparation will be continued in *How To Use* section so [hop in](#how-to-use) if you want!
